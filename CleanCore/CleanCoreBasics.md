# Clean Core for SAP S/4HANA Cloud - Basics
My notes from the SAP Training [Managing Clean Core for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/managing-clean-core-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud) 

Traditionally, companies hosted and managed SAP's ERP systems within their own data centers. However, with the introduction of cloud-based ERP systems like SAP S/4HANA Cloud, updates are delivered continuously.

This continuous update model necessitates a different strategy for managing extensions and integrations compared to the traditional on-premise environment. To address this, SAP introduced the "clean core" concept, which customers can adopt to optimize the performance and efficiency of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud offers a robust platform for customers to leverage technological advancements. Since it's a cloud-based ERP, SAP handles all updates, reducing the need for extensive IT resources and minimizing business disruptions.

The system comes with integrated security, compliance, and scalability, ensuring that essential operations like backups, disaster recovery, system maintenance, and data protection are automatically managed, providing customers with peace of mind.

Customers can take advantage of SAP S/4HANA Cloud's built-in features, including automated updates, cloud-native architecture, and inherent compliance and scalability.

## Why A Clean Core Is Necessary
- **Business Change:** Disruption of supply chains, Changing customer preferences, Regulatory compliance.
- **New Technologies:** Embrace new technological advancements, accelerate innovation, optimize and automate business processes, and foster agility (ability to pivot quickly).
- **Landscape Compexity:** Business model adaptations, Key application adjustments, Changing customer preferences, Cloud Computing and Agile Development, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP.

## Clean Core Components
Clean Core Dimensions:
- Processes
- Extensions
- Data
- Integrations
- Operations

When we refer to "Clean," it means that for each of the dimensions mentioned, there is a specific set of best practices, methodologies, and tools available. By following these, customers can ensure that the respective dimension is considered "clean." Each dimension has its own tailored best practices, methodologies, and tools designed to achieve this.

In the ideal scenario for a clean core, the system is fully up-to-date with the latest release, features cloud-compliant extensions and integrations, maintains high-quality master data, and has flawlessly designed processes.

By definition, a newly provisioned SAP S/4HANA Cloud system is clean. The customer's objective, therefore, is to maintain this clean core over time.

For customers opting for a system conversion or system landscape transformation, the primary goal is to to get (and then keep) the core clean.

Some key characteristics of a clean core include:
- A streamlined and optimized version of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, focusing exclusively on essential functionalities to deliver maximum efficiency.
- Elimination of unnecessary features, customizations, and complexities to simplify the ERP system's core codebase.
- Improved maintainability, reduced technical debt, and enhanced overall system performance.

### Features of Clean Core components
- **Minimalism:** Focuses on simplicity by removing redundant or obsolete functionalities, leaving only essential components.
- **Modularity:** Supports breaking down the ERP system into loosely coupled modules, making maintenance and adaptation easier.
- **Scalability:** Enables the system to grow and evolve without compromising performance or stability.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies the codebase, making it easier for developers to understand, modify, and enhance the system.
- **Stability and Reliability:** Enhances stability by reducing dependencies, minimizing bugs, and improving overall system reliability.

### Results after achieving a Clean Core:
- **Improved Performance:** Optimization and minimalism lead to faster system response times and greater user satisfaction in the now clean ERP.
- **Simplified Development:** Developers benefit from a streamlined codebase, leading to better productivity and shorter development cycles.
- **Enhanced Stability and Reliability:** Eliminating unnecessary complexities reduces the likelihood of bugs and errors, making the ERP system more reliable and stable.
- **Cost Reduction:** The clean core decreases maintenance efforts, resulting in less downtime and lower overall maintenance costs.

### Key points for a Clean Core implementation:
- **Thorough Business Analysis:** Start by conducting a comprehensive business analysis to identify critical functionalities before initiating clean core development.
- **Modular Development:** Utilize modular development frameworks and practices to ensure loose coupling and scalability.
- **Continuous Performance Review:** Regularly assess the ERP system's performance to identify opportunities for further optimization and code cleanup.
- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Engage stakeholders from various departments to ensure alignment with business goals and requirements.

### Misconceptions about Clean Core
- **SAP BTP is the Only Way to Maintain a Clean Core:** While SAP BTP is essential for creating side-by-side extensions (a key aspect of clean core), SAP S/4HANA Cloud also supports both key user and developer extensibility, allowing for clean core management within the stack.
- **Clean Core is Only About Custom Code and Extensibility:** Clean core encompasses more than just custom code and extensions; it also impacts business processes, data management, integrations, and operational practices.
- **Clean Core is Only About Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Although clean core helps reduce TCO, its benefits extend beyond cost savings. It also facilitates access to the latest innovations and supports a shift from on-premise to cloud-based solutions.
- **Fit-to-Standard is the Only Way to Achieve a Clean Core:** While adhering to fit-to-standard practices can lead to a clean core, the use of Tier 1 extensibility options (which will be covered in a later lesson) can also contribute to maintaining a clean core.

### Implementation Types and Clean Core
- **Greenfield (New Implementation):** Adopting the greenfield approach enables a fresh start, allowing for a clean core from the outset. This method ensures greater efficiency and minimizes complexity, as the new system is inherently clean by default.
- **Brownfield (System Conversion):** The target SAP S/4HANA Cloud instance (whether private edition or on-premise) retains some complexities from the previous system, which can be challenging. This approach means inheriting historical complexities and possibly unwanted customizations. Despite these challenges, a clean core can still be achieved through system conversions. While the system doesn’t start clean, the goal is to systematically make it clean. To implement a clean core in this scenario, you must identify which elements of the legacy system to retain, eliminate, or transform. This requires a deep understanding of the current system's functions and a clear plan for how SAP S/4HANA Cloud can facilitate the desired changes. The process involves efficiently reconciling old and new elements—transforming and adapting aspects like custom code—to ensure compliance with the clean core principles of SAP S/4HANA.

When deciding between a greenfield or brownfield approach, several factors come into play, with business processes being a crucial consideration.
- If the client is ready and capable of adopting new business processes aligned with current best practices through a fit-to-standard approach, a greenfield strategy is a viable option. This approach allows them to implement a clean core from the start, free from the constraints of legacy coding and design.
- If the existing system involves complex business processes that are essential and would be costly or difficult to redesign from scratch, a brownfield approach may be more suitable. While a clean core remains the goal, this approach allows for the preservation of critical business processes while working to achieve a clean core.

Applying clean core principles in migrating to SAP S/4HANA Cloud involves balancing business requirements with implementation strategies. As developers, our role extends beyond coding; we serve as crucial intermediaries in ensuring that the upgraded system aligns with business needs while adhering to clean core principles.

A greenfield approach offers the most straightforward path to achieving a clean core but may not always be feasible. On the other hand, a brownfield approach, while accommodating specific business complexities, still allows for the transformation and simplification of existing code to comply with clean core standards.

The decision between greenfield and brownfield strategies closely depends on the business context, available resources, and willingness to embrace extensive changes. Understanding the implications of these strategies on clean core principles helps us make informed decisions that best serve the business.
