# Clean Core for SAP S/4HANA Cloud - Basics
Notes from the SAP Training [Managing Clean Core for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/managing-clean-core-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud) 

Traditionally, companies hosted and managed SAP's ERP systems within their own data centers. However, with the introduction of cloud-based ERP systems like SAP S/4HANA Cloud, updates are delivered continuously.

This continuous update model necessitates a different strategy for managing extensions and integrations compared to the traditional on-premise environment. To address this, SAP introduced the "clean core" concept, which customers can adopt to optimize the performance and efficiency of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

SAP S/4HANA Cloud offers a robust platform for customers to leverage technological advancements. Since it's a cloud-based ERP, SAP handles all updates, reducing the need for extensive IT resources and minimizing business disruptions.

The system comes with integrated security, compliance, and scalability, ensuring that essential operations like backups, disaster recovery, system maintenance, and data protection are automatically managed, providing customers with peace of mind.

Customers can take advantage of SAP S/4HANA Cloud's built-in features, including automated updates, cloud-native architecture, and inherent compliance and scalability.

## Why A Clean Core Is Necessary
- **Business Change:** Disruption of supply chains, Changing customer preferences, Regulatory compliance.
- **New Technologies:** Embrace new technological advancements, accelerate innovation, optimize and automate business processes, and foster agility (ability to pivot quickly).
- **Landscape Compexity:** Business model adaptations, Key application adjustments, Changing customer preferences, Cloud Computing and Agile Development, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP.

## Clean Core Components
Clean Core Dimensions:
- Processes

By "Clean", we mean that for each dimension listed above, a set of best practices, methodologies, and tools exist. 

If these are used, they allow the customer to consider that dimension to be "clean". These best practices, methodologies, and tools are specific for each dimension.
