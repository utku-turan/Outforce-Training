# Outforce-Training
Notes & training materials on technical topics.<br>

Greetings,<br>
<!--My name is Utku and I am working as an SAP ABAP developer since 2007. 
To be honest, I have never been an "open-source developer". I usually keep my code and my notes to myself, but the times they are a-changin, and so should I. 
Hence, I've decided to begin sharing more of my work in public repositories, starting with this repository containing my notes on BTP. It might take a while to get everything ready, as I'll need to tidy up the formatting, fix the things that might cause copyright issues, etc. Hopefully, I would soon find the time and willpower to add my (very unorganized) code archive, too. â€¦ -->

Feel free to contact me at <utku.turan@outforce.tech>.
