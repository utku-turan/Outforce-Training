# Outforce-Training
Notes & training materials on various technical topics.<br>

Hi there,
My name is Utku and I am working as an SAP ABAP developer since 2007.
<!--To be honest, I have never been an "open-source developer". I usually keep my code and my notes to myself, but times are changing, and so should I. 
Hence, I've decided to begin sharing more of my work in public repositories, starting with this repository containing my notes on BTP. It might take a while to get everything ready, as I'll need to tidy up the formatting, fix the things that might cause copyright issues, etc. Hopefully, I would soon find the time and willpower to add my (very unorganized) code archive, too. â€¦ -->

Feel free to contact me at <utku.turan@outforce.tech> for any inquiries.

Please add new trainings to the list below.
